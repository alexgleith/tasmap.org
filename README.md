## What have we here?

This is a simple, fast, lightweight mapping system. It harvests available datasets from Tasmanian State and Local Government authorities and provides basic viewing and information retrieval.

## Whose data?

The map supports GeoServer WMS/WFS and ESRI REST services. If you have one and want to get it in here, get in touch. Currently the map supports data from the following sources:

*   [The LIST](http://www.thelist.tas.gov.au)
*   [Glenorchy City Council](https://maps.gcc.tas.gov.au)
*   [City of Launceston.](http://www.launceston.tas.gov.au/lcc/)

## Who did this?!

This mapping system was put together by Alex Leith for GovHack 2016\. You can contact him at [alexgleith (at) gmail.com](mailto://alexgleith@gmail.com)

## Why doesn't it do X?

Because I built it in a weekend! If you think it should do more, come and chat about it at [GitHub](https://github.com/alexgleith/tasmap.org). You can either submit a pull request or create an issue.
